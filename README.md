## Social Exchange Script

Built off of the idea of EazySubs, a better scipt was built in 2011, at the age of 15, under Tectrify, to provide users with a chance to open their own exchange website. Using plugins, users would be able to buy the social media packages they wanted.

A couple hundred scripts were sold at around $100 each, based on the number of plugins the user selected.
